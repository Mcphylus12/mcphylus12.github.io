# Overview 
This doc is my attempt at putting some granular ideas to the recruiting and line management aspect of being a software developer.

# Interview questions
What questions I would ask to gauge someone competency and team fit.

## Stage 1
### Company
- What do they know about the Company
- What do they know about the Product(s)

### Candidate
- Who are they - get them to introduce themselves?
- Why are they looking to move? what do they enjoy about their current role
- What are they looking for in their career 
  - What do they want to do differently at their next role
  - What are they looking for in the short and medium term? 
  - Any specific areas they find interesting
- Biggest success, biggest mistake
- Hobbies 
  - Any technical hobbies outside of work? Last tech thing learnt outside of work?
  - Any hobbies that aren't tech? Last non tech thing learnt outside of work?

### Process (Experience & Opinion)
- Pair Programming? Last thing you taught someone
- Peer reviews
- Agile
- Scrum

### Tech
- Explain the **technical** challenges of a couple of CV items
- Testing/TDD - Benefits and potentially drawbacks?
- Design Patterns - Pick 2 and talk about why they are good and what sort of problem could be solved with them?
- Solid Principles - pick 2 and talk about why they are good and what a violation looks like? (Also do they see any drawbacks)
- Pick 2 important things for creating good software
- Walk through some basic steps finding an issue in a hypothetical web app
- Notable Frameworks/Libraries
- Thoughts on latest languages features in [c#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history)

- For High level hires
  - in a hypothetical green field system (B/E, F/E, DBs and Devops) Pick 2 and walk through a couple of options with reasonings. Explain a bit about the system as a start but leave areas deliberately vague to prompt questions.

## Stage 2
- Technical Test (not a random code kata but something related to what they would do in the day to day)
- Re-ask about any tech questions they didn't know in first stage to see if they've done reading between
- Best bug they've found/fixed
- If you could go to any time period which one would it be
- Interest in any other programming languages
  - Comparison to C#


# Progression

## Specialisation Areas
- Project management
- Front end design
- QA (Automation)
- Architecture
- Databases/Data
- Devops
- Product ownership
- Business Analytics
- Security

## Jnr
- Motivated and proactive learner
- Needs Check-ins to make sure they are on the right track
- Should spend longer fixing bugs/working on stories to learn areas of the codebase
- PD should be around technical excellence foundations like Design patterns and solid
  - There should be proactive interest to progress in these areas
- No specialisation
- No expectation of consistent meeting involvement but need to see confidence they will put an idea forward when they have it
- Much more learner than teacher

### Transition to mid: 
- Gaining knowledge and confidence to complete work independently. 
- Aiming for the mindset of best solution not first solution.
- responds well to requests for help in parts of the system they worked on
- Demonstrates time management skills 
- Improving contributions to meetings and team discussions

## Mid
- Continued Learning in foundations but now demonstrating knowledge in where to apply them in upcoming work
- They can justify why they solved a problem a particular way
- Expected to be able to handle sprint work independently (Task levels)
- Looking to specialise in an interest
- Consistent meeting involvement asking questions and ensuring they are up to speed
- 50/50 Learner teacher
- Can be given ownership of problems and idea (needs help planning but can handle the work by themselves)
- May still have areas of the system they are not completely comfortable working in

### Transition to snr
- Demonstrable Knowledge and skill in specialisation
- Apparent they proactively help those around them and others rely on them for knowledge
- Showing elements of leadership in meetings 
- Several examples of handling extra responsibilities. Showing time management and Small scale project management skills(planning, understanding stakeholders)
- Capable of picking up work across the system with negligible difference in speed of delivery that cant be accounted for with things like differences in code quality

## Snr
- Is Active in meetings. Sometimes Running them and expected to pitch ideas/start conversations
- Is a quick enough worker that they can contribute same as mid level while also spending time mentoring/Working on ad hoc side requests
- Can be given problem and can plan and execute to a high level
- Contributing and leading in their specialisation within the team
- Actively looking to teach and mentor juniors/mids. And taking responsibility for juniors not getting stuck and blocked (eg checking in)
- expected to be able to take their hand to any part of the products they work on
- Will take on delegated matters of team leadership/direction

### Transition to principal
- Takes time to stay up to date on work they are not directly involved in
- Proactively pushes the team as a whole to improve
- Is looked to from outside the team on their specialisation and the systems they work on

## Principal/Tech lead
- Is expected to book and lead meetings regarding technical quality
- Is a wider point of contact on their specialisation within the company
- Keeps a rolling understanding of the larger systema and functions as a point of contact for any technical questions in their area
- Actively consistent participation in matters regarding team direction and philosiphy
