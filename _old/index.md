# About Me

My name's Kyle and you've managed to stumble across my attempt at having something slightly more than a LinkedIn page. I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of East Anglia after taking my love of problem solving to computers when I was in high school.

I have spent most of my educational time writing Java using Swing and AWT to build forms and simple 2d games. I got into web with a summer internship at university writing mobile applications using Ionic and AngularJS.

My university modules included writing 3D graphics applications using OpenGL, Embedded systems with C and Using Design Patterns to build a reusable mobile framework for Android.

As a software engineer I am an advocate of clean object oriented programming and design using SOLID principles and TDD. For me the best experience is having a colleague send you a message just saying thanks for writing that one class in a way that made their life easier.

In my free time I enjoy video games, team based sports and just generally chilling out. I am making this site and blog as a way to motivate myself to learn and use new technologies while working on personal projects in my own time.
